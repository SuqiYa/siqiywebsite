<h2>Reading Response #001: In Plato's Cave</h2>

<p>Based on Susan Sontag’s opening chapter, “In Plato’s Cave”, capturing and creating graphics means an illusion of the real world. As images capture meaning, which can make one overthink the meaning of the images. This will make the one who took and worked on the image lose the sense of reality as they prioritize getting an image rather than the real life experience of it. This will in turn make the person lose themselves into the loop of capturing images and not experiencing reality. One great example the author gives is Plato's Allegory of the Cave, in which the shadows represent the images we took, and while we represent the person trapped in the cave never stepping out. Furthermore, with the illusions we created inside the cave we feel more attached and less willing to leave the cave. Therefore, we should view images as only an object, a tool that's tangible and cheap to decrease the influence of images on one’s mind.
<p>To me capturing images is to keep the memories of happy moments in life in which I can look back and remember or reexperience it anytime, anywhere after the moment happened. Also, to capture images I will be able to look back closely to the objects and people without being rushed making observations and storing of information easier. This makes me acknowledge the fact that when capturing images, I can choose what to keep in the frame and what to keep out. This allows me to focus on the important parts of the places I observed, instead of having distractions of multiple items in one place. Overall, I realized capturing or creating images is based on what I want to see and remember even as days pass by and not an image filled with meaning and lessons.</p>
<p>Throughout this semester I will make 10 projects. Based on the project I have already done, I believe most of the projects will be incorporating images into each assignment, whether it's through using photoshop or writing about what the image means to me. Together they will create my website and finalize the website online to let anyone who wants to work with me view. These projects will be albums showcasing what I learned and what skills I acquired because of this class. This will allow me to create a whole new image based on all the skills I learned in this semester.</p>
<p>Representing visually through photography or illustration or the combination of image and text notions of our world at this moment isn’t truly feasible as the world is filled with different kinds of people, animals and plants. Choosing one or few can represent parts of the world but not the entirety of it. But, capturing the world allows me to put meaning and symbols that might capture the meaning of the world. Making capturing images an object a vital element in representing parts of our world. Overall, the combination of my words and images will bring others to understand my image or bring their own new perspective into my images.</p>

<h2>Reading Response #002: AI Slop Article</h2>

<p>AI slope is a phrase used when AI-generated content or images have taken over the internet, as platforms like Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, have grown. Many of these AI-generated images or content rely on people’s desires to thrive and still be used to generate money; whether small or large, both will be accepted by these platforms. These platforms will make little to no effort to monetize or decrease the amount of AI-generated content. This will allow people in politics, like Donald Trump, to use AI to generate political propaganda or ideas to distract or manipulate the common people, especially the elderly, as they haven’t learned what AI-generated image or content looks like. There was a clear example when a grandma believed there was a Sudanese war based on the images and texts from her close family members or friends.
</p>
<p>Adding on to how easy it is to generate images, it is also fairly easy to share the image you created with others who weren’t in the know that the image or content you sent was created by AI. Recently, there was a trend on Facebook or TikTok in which the creator would generate a homeless man showing up to their house and do an activity like touring around the house. Followed by the angry or concerned reaction of either their partner or their parents. With young individuals who follow these creators, they might start doing this trend, making more people follow in their footsteps and only be content with AI usage.
</p>
While some AI-generated content is cute or funny, most is based on fantasy-like images. Some of these are female-generated images based on a male’s fetish or desire for how a woman should look. This makes the content biased and reinforces white supremacy and male dominance. Making social problems that might have progressed and become less acceptable revert to the beginning, especially when people are online, not being mindful of what they are posting.
<p>In order to move away from AI generated content and human-created content, platforms like Facebook should make regulations or rules to at least let the viewers know that that image or content is AI generated and not human-made. As many people are desensitized and might not be able to discern what is AI and what is real. Furthermore, with AI taking over many industries, people should educate themselves on the harm of everyday AI viewing and usage to lessen or decrease the number of people who use AI. Thus lessening the effects of AI on their lives or the lives of their close relatives or friends.
</p>

<p>Overall, AI generated content shouldn’t be popularized, making its usage increase, as the effects of AI will lead people to make assumptions on events that might not have happened and on what they believe is right and wrong. People should also stop supporting AI generated content to prove to the platforms that have this content that it is unprofitable and thus support decreases and human-created content increases. For the future we shouldn’t be controlled by AI in order to stay humane and mindful.</p>
