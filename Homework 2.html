<p>First picture has a lot of information, making this very interesting but bland, as it's whited out. So I choose a layer to change the yellowish color to make the white light pop. I also make the picture bigger to fit the 1920 px x 1080 px. This makes the items in the after look bigger and more centered around the door of the childcare center. What I want to do next time is, since my picture was really blurry, I want a filter or layer to make the items less blurry.  After these changes I felt my picture felt almost haunting and eerie with the yellow color, which makes this more interesting. I choose this one to have more space because I want to show everything in the picture.</p>

<p>I chose a piano picture for my second one, as I wanted to mess with the color of the image to make it look like an old-school picture, and changed it to 5 in x 7 in. I also make the light and dark contrast more apparent with it having more brighter areas and fewer darker areas. I also made the color of the image turn more orange with an orange filter. I had around 4 layers for the 2nd picture, making this have more layers than the first picture. I make the picture larger and cut off most of the right side of the image, making the piano keys the center of attention. I made this be the smaller one since i just want to make the piano stand out.</p>
