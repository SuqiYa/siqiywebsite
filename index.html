<h1>Siqi's Portfolio</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Siqi, an aspiring screenwriter who has written half-show sitcoms to horror short films. From a young age, I always liked to make up stories and enact them in real life using my stuffed animals. I also watched a variety of movies, from sweet romances to dark and disturbing documentaries. This allowed me to have a broad knowledge of films, allowing me to choose and write any genre I like.</p>
<p>Recently, I have started watching game shows like The Great Escape. This game touches on real-life events and detective work work and solving puzzles, allowing the player to find out and experience the whole story. This game show also made me interested in trying an escape room. The elaborate and distinct designs and stories of each episode made this show feel like Mango TV truly respects and has a passion for it.
